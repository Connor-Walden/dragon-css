## Name
Take flight with Dragon! A CSS framework built for champions.

## Description
This CSS framework started as a joke made during my web development bootcamp... And it turned into what it is now! This framework was written in 100% vanilla CSS and is cross-browser compatible. This framework uses a grid system and all components try to stretch to fit the column they are in... There are many new features in the grid that allow offsetting columns by however many column widths you want and a dock class to make sure a column is stuck to the left of the row.

## Features
- Powerful grid system
- Custom default styling
- Custom padding classes
- Custom margin classes
- Custom border classes
- Custom font classes
- Color any text or component in any of our classes ([COLOR] and text-[COLOR])
- Easy to use utility classes such as rounded, unselectable, shadow-in and shadow-out subtly but strongly change your components.
