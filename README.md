## Name
Take flight with Dragon! A CSS framework built for champions.

## Description
This CSS framework started as a joke made during my web development bootcamp... And it turned into what it is now! This framework was written in 100% vanilla CSS and is cross-browser compatible. This framework uses a grid system and all components try to stretch to fit the column they are in... In the future there will be a whole host of flex-based classes to organise your content within it's column.

## Features
- Powerful grid system
- Custom default styling
- Custom padding classes
- Custom margin classes
- Custom border classes
- Custom font classes
- Recolor: color any text or component in any of our classes (bg-[COLOR] and text-[COLOR])

## Components
- Buttons
- Alerts
- Badges
- Statements
- Dropdowns
- Lists
- Forms
